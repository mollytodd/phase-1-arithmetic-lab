let multiply = 62

let num1 = multiply / num2

let num2 = multiply / num1

// this seems like a sloppy way of doing this lol

let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 0;
// is this the best way to do this???? 

//mathrandom() returns a random number between 0 and .99. which 
//is why we multiply by 10
// we add math floor to round to nearest whole number

let mod = 4

let num3 = multiply % mod

let num4 = multiply % mod

// tab9 helped me figure this out. need to figure out how to do this. here is some definitions

//Division: It divides the left operand by the right operand.
//Remainder: It returns the remainder obtained from the division.
//Here's an example to illustrate how the remainder operator works:

//javascript
///opy code
//let dividend = 17;
//let divisor = 5;

//let remainder = dividend % divisor;
//console.log(remainder);  // Output: 2
//In this example, the dividend is 17, and the divisor is 5. 
//When we perform the division operation 17 / 5, the quotient i
//s 3 with a remainder of 2. The remainder operator % returns the remainder, 
//which is 2 in this case.

let max = 20

let min = 0

Math.max()/Math.min()

//Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20.
